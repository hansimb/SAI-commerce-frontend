(milestones specified in part 7)

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a production-grade international e-commerce website for a small business manufacturing high-end & custom audio electronic products.

The primary objective is not only to launch a functional online store, but to build a technically solid, modern, and extensible commerce architecture with a fully custom UI/UX and a product customization feature as a core differentiator.

The solution must:

- Provide a highly customized web storefront cross-platfom experience
- Enable advanced product customization
- Remain maintainable with low operational overhead
- Leverage SaaS infrastructure for commerce-critical functionality
- Be extensible for future internal system integrations

---

## 2. Key Architectural Decision

After evaluating multiple approaches (fully self-hosted, open-source commerce stacks, CMS-driven architectures, hybrid solutions), the following architecture was selected:

### Backend (Commerce Layer)

- Headless Shopify (SaaS) as a backend:
  - Storefront API (GraphQL)
  - Admin API (for future integrations)

### Frontend

- Hydrogen (React-based framework by Shopify)
- TypeScript-based implementation
- Leveraging shopify API:s for data and selected e-commerce UI components
- Custom UI components & component libraries if needed (Chakra UI etc)

### DevOps

- Hosting and deployment by Oxygen for production

### Content management

No separate content management system (CMS) will be used in Milestone 1.

Content will initially be managed through Shopify’s Admin (products, collections, blog posts, metafields, metaobjects).

A separate CMS integration was considered but postponed. It may be evaluated in the future if content modeling requirements exceed Shopify’s native capabilities.

---

## 3. Core Project Goals

### 3.1 Custom UI / UX

A primary objective is to create a storefront that does not resemble a traditional template-based e-commerce site.

The site should:

- Reflect strong brand identity
- Avoid generic “grid-of-products” aesthetics
- Provide a boutique-style digital experience
- Prioritize storytelling and product immersion
- Be fully responsive and performance-optimized

All layout, typography, styling, and component structures will be implemented in the custom frontend.

Shopify will not control/restrict by themes or layout.

---

### 3.2 Product Customization Feature (Primary Technical Focus)

The most critical feature of the project is a product customization system.

This will allow customers to:

- Configure product options dynamically
- View real-time changes in price and configuration
- Interact with a tailored UI beyond standard Shopify variant selection
- Customizations specified to individual products

This feature is one main reason for choosing a headless architecture.

---

## 4. Alternatives Considered

Several alternatives were evaluated before selecting the final architecture:

### 4.1 Traditional Shopify Theme

Rejected because:

- Limited frontend flexibility
- Constrained UI/UX control
- Harder to implement advanced customization logic cleanly

### 4.2 Fully Self-Hosted Open Source Commerce (e.g., Medusa)

Rejected because:

- Increased responsibility for security and reliability
- Higher operational and maintenance overhead
- Not aligned with goal of minimizing commerce infrastructure risk

### 4.3 Separate Headless CMS + Custom Commerce

Considered but postponed because:

- Introduces additional infrastructure complexity
- Not required for initial launch scope
- Shopify’s native content tools are sufficient for Milestone 1

---

## 5. Why Shopify + Hydrogen + Oxygen

This stack provides:

- SaaS-managed commerce backend (security, payments, checkout, compliance)
- Full control over frontend architecture
- Officially supported headless framework (Hydrogen)
- Integrated hosting environment (Oxygen)
- Production-ready deployment model
- Clean separation of concerns between commerce and presentation

This solution balances:

- Technical depth
- Architectural clarity
- Low operational risk
- Long-term extensibility

---

## 6. Maintenance Considerations

The selected architecture ensures:

- Commerce-critical systems are maintained by Shopify
- No responsibility for payment security (PCI compliance handled by Shopify)
- Limited infrastructure management overhead
- Frontend codebase fully under project control

Maintenance scope will primarily include:

- Dependency updates (Hydrogen, npm ecosystem)
- Minor feature improvements
- Shopify API version upgrades
- Performance monitoring

This is considered manageable within long-term project scope.

---

## 7. Milestones

### Milestone 1 (this plan) – Public Storefront

Scope:

- Shopify store setup (by merchant)
- Hydrogen storefront implementation
- Oxygen deployment
- Custom UI/UX
- Product customization feature
- Integration with Shopify Storefront API
- Production deployment

This milestone delivers a fully functional public e-commerce site.

---

### Milestone 2 – Internal Systems & Tools

Scope (high-level, subject to further planning):

- Development or integration of internal business tools (e.g., ERP, inventory management, operational dashboard)
- Self-hosted internal system if required
- Integration with Shopify Admin API
- Automated data synchronization (orders, inventory, product data)

This milestone extends the project beyond storefront into business infrastructure.

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. Create detailed UI/UX design proposal
2. Merchant creates Shopify account
3. Define product data structure (variants, metafields, customization logic)
4. Approve design direction
5. Initialize Hydrogen project
6. Begin storefront implementation
